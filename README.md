# Drawn Tic-Tac-Toe

This Tic-Tac-Toe app draws itself across your screen and invites you to challenge an unbeatable CPU player to this classic game.

Upon loading the game, the Tic-Tac-Toe grid draws itself in and the user is asked to select between the 'X' or 'O' symbol. As the user and the CPU place their symbols on the board, the symbols are drawn in. Try as they might, the user cannot hope to beat the CPU. At best, they can achieve a draw. If the user is not careful, the CPU's logic is coded to pursue a win rather than just place symbols randomly on the board. Once the game is over, the user is prompted to start over and pick a new symbol.

User can:

* Play a game of Tic Tac Toe with the computer
* Reset the game as soon as its over to play again
* Choose whether to play as 'X' or 'O'

Tech Highlights:

* Used an SVG animation library *KUTE.js* to draw the shapes
* Coded the CPU logic and strategy from stratch in vanilla JS
